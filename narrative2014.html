       <p>This website uses the World Happiness Indicators dataset to explore the relationship between GDP and social support within a country. Through these graphs, we can explore three different years and see the trend towards increased GDP and social support. </p>
       <p>This is an <b>Interactive Slideshow</b> that allows the viewer to cycle through three years of data and see the trend towards more social support. We can see that GDP and social support are highly correlated and tend to increase together.</p>
