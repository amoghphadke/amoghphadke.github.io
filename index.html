<h1>Amogh Phadke</h1>
<h2>A little bit about myself.</h2>
<p>Hi! My name is Amogh Phadke and I'm a second year computer science major at UGA. Other than CS, I love to play sports, eat all types of food, and attempt to write comedy pieces. In terms of academics, I love multidisciplinary subjects that challenge every part of the mind. I have interest in quantitative trading, consulting, and product management because they draw from many fields. My goal for Summer 2019 is to secure an internship in one of these fields.</p>
